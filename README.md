## Problem Description:
Airbnb is an Online home-sharing marketplace for arranging or offering  lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. Since its inception in 2008,  Airbnb has seen an enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its  website growing exponentially each year.    
Rental Hostings has become very interesting for most households in cities  like Singapore which is very small but heavily urbanised. Therefore, being able to  accurately value the prices will not only facilitate market transactions by providing  valuable guidance for all market participants (be it home owners, visitors, airbnb or  its competitors), but also provide useful insights for policy makers and government  authorities in understanding the current state of this online marketplace.    
In this test, you are expected to create an analytical and modelling  framework to predict the prices based on the quantitative and qualitative features
